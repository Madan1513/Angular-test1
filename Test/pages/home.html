    <h1>WELCOME TO MANUEL DUB<br>
      FESTIVAL VOLUNTEERS</h1>
    <p>Manuel Dub is a strictly not-for-profit event dedicated to the memory of Manuel. On the one hand, this has enabled us to host some of dub musicâ€™s finest artists who after feeling moved by the energy, dedication and love that goes into the event agree to perform for a  reduced fee or even free of charge. On the other hand it means that we are in constant need of  volunteers to make it happen and keep it going</p>
